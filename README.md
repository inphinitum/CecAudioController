Controller of audio devices via different options. Provided today:
- HDMI and CEC-compatible.

Can listen to events via a REST API, or be called with specific commands.

## Dependencies
This project depends on [libcec](https://github.com/Pulse-Eight/libcec). Due to license incompatibilities
it can't be distributed together with this project.

## Examples

```python
with SessionHandler() as session:
    session.active(True)
    session.play()
```
```python
with DeviceControllerCec() as controller:
    controller.standby()
```
```python
with EventHandler(session, config) as ev_handler:
    while True:
        ev_handler.listen_for_events()
```

## Configuration file

The configuration file has the following format:
```
[EventServer]
rest_url=http://localhost:8080/endpoint

[MediaFormat]
events = "Events"
pb_notif = "Notification"
pb_notif_stop = 0
pb_notif_play = 1
pb_notif_pause = 2
pb_notif_active_device = 3
pb_notif_inactive_device = 4

[DeviceControl]
power_off_delay_mins = 10
```

`EventServer` holds info about the REST endpoint, `MediaFormat` about the REST API message format,
and `DeviceControl` about how the device should be controlled.

## audio_controller

`audio_controller` is provided as an example of how the library can be used standalone.

```bash
$ audio_controller -event_listener
```
```bash
$ audio_controller -power_on
```
```bash
$ audio_controller -standby
```
